            <abstract>Neighborhood Map Atlas neighborhoods are derived from the Seattle City Clerk's Office Neighborhood Map Atlas.  These are the smallest neighborhood areas and have been supplemented with alternate names from other sources in 2020.  They roll up to the district areas.  The sub-neighborhood field contains the most common name and the alternate name field is a comma delimited list of all the alternate names.The original atlas is designed for subject indexing of legislation, photographs, and other documents and is an unofficial delineation of neighborhood boundaries used by the City Clerks Office. Sources for this atlas and the neighborhood names used in it include a 1980 neighborhood map produced by the Department of Community Development, Seattle Public Library indexes, a 1984-1986 Neighborhood Profiles feature series in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, numerous parks, land use and transportation planning studies, and records in the Seattle Municipal Archives. Many of the neighborhood names are traditional names whose meaning has changed over the years, and others derive from subdivision names or elementary school attendance areas.Disclaimer:
The Seattle City Clerk's Office Geographic Indexing Atlas is designed for
subject indexing of legislation, photographs, and other records in the City
Clerk's Office and Seattle Municipal Archives according to geographic area.
Neighborhoods are named and delineated in this collection of maps in order to
provide consistency in the way geographic names are used in describing records
of the Archives and City Clerk, thus allowing precise retrieval of records. The
neighborhood names and boundaries are not intended to represent any
&amp;quot;official&amp;quot; City of Seattle neighborhood map. 

The Office of the City Clerk makes no claims
as to the completeness, accuracy, or content of any data contained in the
Geographic Indexing Atlas; nor does it make any representation of any kind,
including, but not limited to, warranty of the accuracy or fitness for a
particular use; nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with
respect to the representations furnished herein. The maps are subject to change
for administrative purposes of the Office of the City Clerk. Information
contained in the site, if used for any purpose other than as an indexing and
search aid for the databases of the Office of the City Clerk, is being used at
one's own risk.</abstract>
